"""Parse a repo README's tables into canonical snapshot rows, and judge the result.

No scraping. These are tables in public repos, so `gather.github_readme` asks the API
for the default branch and fetches the raw README, and this diffs at the row level keyed
on company + role -- not on raw text, which would fire on every badge and emoji change.

Each repo gets its own parser config because the five READMEs share almost nothing:
NUFT puts the company in the `##` heading above a two-column table, Cruz-Lopez has seven
different header layouts, Simplify uses HTML `<table>` rather than markdown, and zapply
and LuisaE fold company and role into a single linked `Name` column. A "generic markdown
table differ" would produce noise for four of the five.

The stored snapshot is a canonical one-line-per-row rendering rather than the README
itself. That is what makes `git log` readable: a newly posted role is exactly one added
line, instead of a 700KB blob reflowing.

Pure. No network, no disk -- `previous` arrives as an argument.

# reported as changed and the pipeline treated every one as news.

# Proportional, unlike the ATS boards' flat 25. An aggregator legitimately posts dozens
# of real rows on a busy morning -- simplify-2027 moved 38 of 625 that same day, all of
# them genuine -- so a flat count would either collapse a real morning or never fire on

# and the floor is what stops a 12-row repo tripping on three postings.
