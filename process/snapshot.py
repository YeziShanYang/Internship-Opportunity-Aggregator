"""Snapshot shape shared by every source tier.

Extracted from `github_repos` when Tier 2 (ATS job boards) and Tier 3 (page text)
arrived: all three tiers answer the same question -- what does this source look like
today, and what moved since yesterday -- and they must answer it identically or the
digest stops being comparable across sources.

The canonical form is a sorted `# sections` / `# rows` TSV. Sorting is what makes a
newly posted role exactly one added line in `git diff` rather than a reflowed blob,
which is the whole reason state lives in this repo.
