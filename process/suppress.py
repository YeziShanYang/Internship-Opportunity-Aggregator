"""The two run-wide mute filters, and the reports they owe HEALTH.

Both of these sat loose in `check.main` as a pair of inline comprehensions with a
`before - after` subtraction each. That is how one of them managed to be broken for
weeks: `program_names` in sources.csv is "|"-separated, the filter compared the whole
field against a single programme name, and so muting had no effect at all on any source
covering more than one programme -- while reporting through nothing, which is why
nobody noticed it was not filtering. The two halves of the same failure.

Every filter reports what it removed, so each one here returns a `FilterReport` even
when it removed nothing. Reporting zero is the useful case: it is the difference between
"this filter is quiet today" and "this filter is not running".
