"""The process stage: read `.run/raw/`, parse it, and say what moved.

Pure with respect to the network. It reads two things off disk -- the bodies `gather`
just wrote and the snapshots yesterday's run committed -- which is why `persist` sits at
level 1 below `gather` rather than at the end of the pipeline. A write-only persist
stage would have forbidden both reads.

This is the boundary that makes `run.py gather` then `run.py process` twice a meaningful
test: the second process makes zero requests and must produce the identical answer.
