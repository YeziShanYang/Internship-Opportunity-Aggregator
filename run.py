"""Stage runner. One verb per pipeline stage, plus `all` for the daily job.

    run.py all --dry-run          the whole pipeline, printing the digest
    run.py gather                 fetch all ~157 sources into .run/raw/ and stop
    run.py process                parse .run/raw/ and diff it. No network at all
    run.py enrich                 fetch the posting behind each changed row
    run.py screen                 rule out what a quoted phrase settles. No model
    run.py render                 rebuild the digest from .run/. No network, no model
    run.py classify               the model calls, and only the model calls
    run.py deliver                post the rendered digest, subject to the daily cap

The point of the verbs is not that anyone runs them one at a time every morning --
`run.py all` does the whole thing in one process, so the Actions workflow keeps its
single step and nothing about the schedule changes. The point is that when a digest
looks wrong, the question "which stage produced this" has an answer you can read off
disk in `.run/`, instead of requiring the prompts to be reconstructed from the state
commits. That reconstruction has been done once, to work out why 2026-09-12 cost 34
cents, and it should never have needed doing.

Every stage is separately runnable, and each one reads the previous stage's artifact
rather than recomputing it. `run.py gather` then `run.py process` twice produces
byte-identical output with no second fetch; `run.py all` then `run.py render` produces
the byte-identical digest with no network at all.
