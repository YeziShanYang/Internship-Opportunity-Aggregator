"""Level 7: rendering, the HEALTH strings, urgency, and the Issue POST.

Every string the owner reads is composed here, and nothing else composes one. That is
the rule the digest kept breaking: `classify.screen_line()` and `classify.usage_line()`
emitted markdown from a stage forbidden to emit markdown, *and* read module globals to
do it -- which is concretely why `run.py render` could not run on its own. Both are
functions over data here now.

Along with `gather` and `enrich`, one of only three packages permitted to import
`httpx`. That is not an exception grudgingly made: `deliver.issue` POSTs the issue and
asks GitHub whether today's has already been opened, and the second of those is half of
the exactly-once guarantee.
