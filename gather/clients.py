"""The two HTTP clients, and why there are two of them.

This is a credential boundary rather than a style choice. The GitHub client puts
`Authorization: Bearer <GH_PAT>` on every request it makes. While only GitHub was
contacted that was harmless; the moment a job board or a careers page shares the client,
the PAT is sent to boards-api.greenhouse.io, api.lever.co, api.ashbyhq.com and every
firm's marketing site. The web client carries the honest User-Agent and no credentials
at all.

Both live in `gather` because that is the layer that owns the network. `enrich` builds
a web client too and imports it from here, which the layering allows -- a stage may
import at or below its own level.
