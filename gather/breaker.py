"""The circuit breaker: whether a failing source is worth fetching this run.

Borrowed from zshah101's `health.py`. Measured 2026-09-12: nine sources sat at exactly
three consecutive failures with `last_success` empty -- they had never worked once --
and each was being fetched three times a morning forever. Boards do come back
(rate-limit storms, a page mid-deploy), so the window is capped rather than permanent
and one success resets everything.

This lives in `gather` because it is **fetch** policy, and it must never become
**reporting** policy. A quarantined source still appears in HEALTH and still escalates,
because "we have stopped looking" is the strongest form of "this source is blind, not
quiet" (spec 10.1) and the one a reader would most readily assume had not happened.
Quarantining a source silently would be the exact failure this project has been bitten
by twice.
