"""Reading and writing `.run/`, the stage handoff.

Each stage writes an artifact the next one reads, which is what makes every stage
separately runnable and separately inspectable. `run.py all` still runs them in one
process, so the Actions workflow keeps its single step and nothing about the schedule
changes -- the files are for the mornings when something looks wrong and the question is
*which stage* produced it.

`.run/` is gitignored, following the precedent already set by `data/postings_cache/`:
derived, re-fetchable data that would otherwise bury the CSV history that `git log`
exists to answer. The raw bodies in particular are ~157 fetched pages a day.

**Raw bodies are per-source files, not one raw.json.** JSON-escaping a 300 KB HTML page
inflates it 15-30% for nothing; `run.py process --only X` should not have to parse 15 MB
to read one source; and writing the bytes verbatim defers the decode decision to
`process`, where the parser knows the encoding, instead of forcing a lossy
`response.text` at the gather boundary. The other artifacts stay single files -- they are
small, and their whole value is being readable in one look.
