<details><summary>■ RULED OUT (1)</summary>

_Read and judged out of scope. Expand to audit; a wrong call here is the expensive kind, so the reasons are shown rather than hidden. A row ruled out on **value** — it could be applied to, but the role is not worth a morning — carries its full reasoning, because that is a judgement and it has been wrong. A row ruled out on **eligibility** carries the phrase from the posting that did it, which is the whole of the evidence._

- **Senior Platform Engineer @ Remote** — Posting requires junior standing or above; this owner is a rising sophomore for Summer 2027: "rising junior"

## ■ HEALTH
- 6 sources checked · 4 healthy · 2 FAILING
- ⚠ 1 source(s) were not fetched at all — the circuit breaker has them quarantined: crabel-careers
- ⚠ aqr-internship-program: 4 consecutive failures, last success never. redirected to what looks like an error page: https://www.aqr.com/About-Us/Our-Internship-Program -> https://www.aqr.com/404.
- ⚠ crabel-careers: 5 consecutive failures, last success never. quarantined for 24h after 5 consecutive failures, retry after 2026-09-13T07:00+00:00 — it has never succeeded, so check the URL rather than waiting
- · millennium-eightfold: first run, recorded 17 rows as the baseline.
- · job boards: 3900 postings were not student roles and 397 were outside the US.
- ⚠ optiver-students: redirected to a different path: https://optiver.com/a -> https://www.optiver.com/b. The fetch succeeded, but this row is no longer watching the page it was configured for.
- ⚠ simplify-2027: 41 rows changed at once and were collapsed into one item — that reads as a board restructure.
- · readme-ignored-columns: 514 of 1402 rows removed (simplify-2027) — column values dropped as per-run churn rather than news.
- · readme-section-not-included: 888 of 1402 rows removed (simplify-2027) — section did not match this repo's section_include pattern.
- · screen-v1: 1 of 7 rows removed — ruled out on a quoted phrase, with no model call (advanced-standing 1). They are listed in RULED OUT with the phrase that did it.
- classifier: 6 calls · 42,000 in · 12,000 cached · 9,000 out · 7,300 of it reasoning · ~$0.0258 est. (gpt-5-mini, effort=minimal)
- 2 item(s) are muted in data/applied.tsv and were hidden. Delete the line to bring one back.
- 3 item(s) were hidden because every programme their source informs is muted=true in data/programs.csv.
- 1 of 7 changes were filtered out by the classifier (see RULED OUT above).
