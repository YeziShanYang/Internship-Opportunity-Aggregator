"""Golden digest: the rendered bytes may not change unless someone meant them to.

This is the real safety net for a refactor this size. The unit tests assert that each
piece behaves; this asserts that the composition of all of them produces the same issue
body it produced before the code moved. Steps 4 through 9 relocate the renderer, the
urgency rule, the HEALTH strings and the filter counters, and every one of those moves
is the kind that can leave a plausible-looking digest with one line quietly missing --
which is the failure this project has been bitten by twice and cannot detect from the
inside.

Everything non-deterministic is pinned: the date, the calendar reminders, the profile
review date, and the classifier's usage and screen tallies. The calendar *content* is
replaced with fixtures on purpose. The golden is here to notice a change in the
renderer, not to make editing a reminder in calendar_reminders.py a test failure.

When a digest change is deliberate, regenerate with:

    .venv/bin/python tests/test_golden.py --update

and read the diff before committing it. That diff is the review.
