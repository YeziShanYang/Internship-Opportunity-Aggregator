"""JSON codec for the stage artifacts, hand-rolled and about seventy lines.

Deliberately not pydantic. That is four packages becoming six, one of them a compiled
wheel, in order to validate files this same process wrote two hundred milliseconds
earlier. Deliberately not bare `dataclasses.asdict` either: it has no inverse, and it
turns a `tuple` into a `list`, which breaks equality on the `frozen=True` shapes and so
breaks the round-trip test that is the only thing making this module trustworthy.

Three properties earn their place:

* **A version mismatch is a hard error.** A stale `.run/` written before a field was
  renamed must fail loudly. Reading it as a partial answer is the same failure as a
  source that goes quiet instead of failing (spec 10.1) -- and here it would be worse,
  because a half-decoded artifact looks exactly like a day on which nothing changed.
* **A kind mismatch is a hard error too.** The artifacts are small files in one
  directory with similar shapes; `run.py render` handed `enriched.json` should say so
  rather than decode it into an empty digest.
* **Output is stable.** `sort_keys=True` with a fixed indent means field order can never
  produce a whole-file diff, and `ensure_ascii=False` keeps the emoji headings and the
  homoglyph canaries legible in the file rather than as `\\uA4DF` escapes.
