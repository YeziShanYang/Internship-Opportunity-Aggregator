"""Weekly pass for sources the watchlist does not have yet. A job, not a stage.

It does GitHub search (gather), snapshot mining (a read), `record()` (persist) and
`lines()` (render), so it cannot sit at any single level of the stage graph -- which is
why it lives here beside the daily digest rather than pretending to be one layer.


Every other part of this tool watches a fixed list. That list was assembled by hand
once, and it goes stale the moment a new repo appears or a firm moves onto an ATS.
This looks for what is missing, once a week.

It **proposes and never adds**. Adding a source silently changes what the tool watches
forever, and a bad automatic add poisons the digest in a way that is hard to notice --
the same reasoning that keeps the classifier away from the hand-verified `eligible`
column. Candidates land in `data/discovered.csv` and in the digest; accepting one is a
deliberate act through the `/add-opportunity` skill, which already probes robots.txt
and picks the right watchlist.

Three signals, all free:

1. **GitHub search.** `GH_PAT` is already configured and authenticated search allows 30
   requests a minute, so a handful of queries once a week costs nothing.
2. **ATS fingerprint mining of the snapshots we already store.** Zero network, and the
   highest-yield of the three: `drweng`, `schonfeld`, `dvtrading` and
   `belvederetrading` were all sitting in `data/snapshots/*.tsv` as links, unnoticed,
   while the firms were assumed to have no public board. Each mined slug is verified
   with one live call so a dead one is never proposed.
3. **Slug guessing, but only for firms newly added to a tracked repo.** Rotating
   through every known firm weekly would cost hundreds of requests for a low hit rate;
   the Tier 1 diff already reports when a firm appears for the first time, which is
   exactly when guessing is worth doing.

The digest cap is one issue per date and it is absolute, so this cannot open its own
issue. It rides along in Monday's digest as an extra section.

PRIORITY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You triage newly discovered *sources* for an opportunity tracker.

A source is a job board, a company careers page, or a GitHub repository that lists
internships. It is watched every morning and its changes are reported. You are not
judging a posting -- you are judging whether adding this source is worth the owner's
attention at all.

THE PERSON:
{profile.OWNER_PROFILE}

The watchlist already holds about 150 sources: five internship aggregators, and the
boards of some seventy named firms. So the question is never "is this a real internship
source". It is "does this carry something the owner would not otherwise see". Be
sparing. Three sources he adds are worth more than eighteen he skims past.

"priority": answer "high" only if at least one of these is true.

  - QUANTITATIVE FINANCE. A proprietary trading firm, market maker, hedge fund or quant
    research shop. This is his first field, and the one where he wants every posting a
    firm has rather than whichever ones an aggregator happened to list.
  - THE ST. LOUIS REGION. His home is in the St. Louis area, so a firm with a Missouri
    or Metro-East office is a viable summer with no housing to solve.
  - A LARGE AGGREGATOR. A repository with thousands of stars tracking maths, CS or quant
    internships. A small one only duplicates the five already watched.
  - YOU CANNOT TELL WHAT THE FIRM DOES. Not a licence to guess: if the material does not
    identify the business, say "high" and let a human look. Discarding is permanent, so
    an unidentified source must never be thrown away on a hunch.

Answer "low" for everything else. In particular:

  - ALREADY COVERED. The input says "already watched: <source>" when the board was mined
    out of an aggregator this tracker reads every morning, which means its postings
    already reach him in the digest. On its own that is enough for "low" -- overridden
    only by quantitative finance or St. Louis, where whole-board coverage is the point.
  - A generic software employer that runs an internship. Real, but one of thousands, and
    the aggregators list it already.
  - A business whose engineering is not software: aerospace, energy, hardware,
    manufacturing, agriculture, insurance. One software internship among twenty
    mechanical ones does not change what the firm is.
  - Experienced-hire-only, clearance-gated, or recruiting only outside the United States.
  - A test or staging duplicate of a board already proposed.

"description": exactly one sentence, plain and specific, saying what the source is and
  why it does or does not matter to him. Name the firm's actual business rather than
  restating its name. No preamble."""
