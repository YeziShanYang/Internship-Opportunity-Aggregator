"""The morning digest: the job that composes every stage.

Load state, check every enabled source, screen and classify what changed, render a
digest, deliver it as a GitHub Issue, then write state back so the commit that follows
is the audit trail.

A job is not a stage. This one reaches into `gather` (the source checks and, on a
Monday, discovery's GitHub search), `process` (the suppression filters), `classify` and
`deliver`, plus `persist` at both ends -- which is exactly why it lives in `jobs/`
rather than being squeezed into one level of the stage graph.

The process exits non-zero only when something is wrong with the *tool*. A source that
404s, gets blocked, or returns nothing is data: it lands in the health block and bumps
that source's failure count. Spec section 10.1 -- silent success is the failure mode
that kills projects like this, so "the job exited 0" must never be the only evidence
that anything happened.
