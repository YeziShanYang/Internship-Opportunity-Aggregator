"""Standing calendar reminders (spec section 7).

The most schedule-critical items are the least automatable. Intercollegiate competition
announcements go out on Instagram, university listservs and club mailing lists *before*
the website changes, and Jane Street's ETC and Symposium arrive by email through campus
recruiting. Rather than pretend to watch those, the digest prints a reminder during the
window when each one historically opens.

Pure data, no network. Anything added here should be something a page diff genuinely
cannot catch.
