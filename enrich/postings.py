"""Fetch the real job posting behind a board row, so the classifier has something to judge.

A `simplify-2027` row is a title, a company and a location -- nothing a relevance filter
can act on. Measured on the snapshot: 7 of 592 rows mention any class-year word at all,
and all 7 are incidental matches on "Graduate Researcher". That is why the classifier
used to skip this source entirely: not because the rows were unimportant, but because
there was no information in them to be right or wrong about.

The posting page does carry it. Measured on a random sample of 22 live postings,
7 (~32%) state a class-year gate that excludes a first-year -- "rising junior",
"penultimate year", "third year", an expected-graduation window. Fetching turns a row
that could only ever be guessed at into one that can be decided.

Three findings that shape this module:

* **Prefer Simplify's own page when a row has one.** Simplify rows carry two links:
  the employer's ATS (Workday, iCIMS, Greenhouse, Oracle HCM) and
  `simplify.jobs/p/{uuid}`. The ATS link is often a dead end for a plain fetch --
  Workday returns literally zero characters, because the posting renders entirely in
  JavaScript -- while Simplify's page returns 13K-34K characters including the
  requirements block. A row with *only* an employer link (every zshah-2027 row) is no
  longer skipped: a page that comes back as a shell is re-read in headless Chromium by
  `enrich.browser`, which turned Workday's 0 characters into 7,457 (2026-09-26).
* **The honest User-Agent works.** `paths.USER_AGENT` and a browser string return byte
  identical responses (140,325 bytes on the page tested), so there is no reason to
  pretend to be a browser. `robots.txt` allows `/p/` (`Allow: /`, and `/p` is absent
  from the disallow list) and sets no crawl-delay.
* **A short page is a failure, not an empty posting.** The JS-shell case returns HTTP
  200 with no content. Treating that as "posting has no requirements" would silently
  turn a fetch failure into a relevance judgment, which is the one thing this must not
  do -- see `fetch_text`.
